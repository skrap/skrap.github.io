Recently, I've been working on the i.MX7 SDMA engine, trying to get it to push more data than the stock system is typically capable of.  I have had some good successes, and I wanted to write down what I've learned.  I know that Future Jonah will, at least, be thankful for the reminder!

I wrote up my findings in a series of posts. Here's what's in the series.  Enjoy, and feel free to pass along any comments back to me!
