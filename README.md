# This & Me

This is a blog, written by an engineer.  If you think this stuff is neat, I'm afraid you might be a giant nerd.

I am a nerd, too!  I like computers, and have been a professional software engineer since 2003.  I am a generalist, which basically means I like trying lots of different things.
